How to compile cito
===================

`cito` is currently written in C#.

You can build it with .NET Core 3.0 on Windows, macOS and Linux
or Visual Studio 2019 on Windows only.

.NET Core SDK is available at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
Build `cito` with the following command line:

    dotnet build

The Visual Studio build is also command-line based and relies on GNU Make.
I recommend installing GNU Make with https://www.msys2.org/
Build using:

    make

## Testing

The test system is under construction. Currently it only supports the VS build.
Additionally you need:
* Perl 5 (install from MSYS2)
* Clang C and C++ compilers (install from MSYS2)
* Java compiler
* Node.js (install from MSYS2)

Run the tests with:

    make test

`-jN` is supported and strongly recommended.
